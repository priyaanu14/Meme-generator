# Meme-generator

I completed this react app as a pert of y react course in scrimba. I got to learn how to take and render data from an API to the UI. use of useEffect() hook and useState() hook. 
Also learnt about controlled inputs and how could we maintain state of diffrent types of inputs present inside a form.

This project takes up memes data from https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes API and which is then stored in a state and among which one meme is randomly choosed and there's a form present with two inputs and a get meme button. As the user gives input in those inputs texts at top and bottom of the image gets appeared.
