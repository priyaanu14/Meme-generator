# Meme-generator

I completed this react app as a part of my react course on freecodecamp by BOB ZIROLL. I got to learn how to take and render data from an API to the UI, When and where to use useEffect() hook and useState() hook. 
Also learnt about controlled inputs and how could we maintain state of diffrent types of inputs present inside a form by maintaining "Single source of truth".

This project takes up memes data from https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes API and which is then stored in a allmemes state and among which one meme image is randomly choosed which gets rendered in UI as you click get meme image button and there's a form present with two inputs and a get meme button. As the user gives input in those inputs, texts at top and bottom of the image gets appeared.
